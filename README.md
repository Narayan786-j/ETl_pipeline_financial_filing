📌 Project Overview

This project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to process financial filings (HTML/PDF).
It extracts structured tables (Balance Sheet, Income Statement), cleans and standardizes them, applies data quality checks, and prepares the data for downstream analytics.

The pipeline is fully Dockerized for portability and reproducibility.

🚀 Features

✅ Parse HTML and PDF filings

✅ Extract multi-page / multi-row header tables

✅ Normalize metrics (e.g., Net Income vs Net Earnings)

✅ Ensure consistent units (USD millions)

✅ Apply 5+ quality checks

✅ Read from input_file.txt

✅ Containerized with Docker

⚙️ Setup & Installation

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/etl_pipeline.git
cd etl_pipeline

2️⃣ Install Dependencies (optional if not using Docker)

pip install -r requirements.txt

🐳 Running with Docker

Build Image
docker build -t etl_pipeline:latest .

Run Container
docker run --rm -it -v "C:\Users\NARAYAN JHA\Downloads\Assignment_Jr_Data_Engineer\Assignment_Jr_Data_Engineer:/app/data" etl_pipeline:latest


Input files: listed inside input_file.txt
Output files: stored in /app/output (map with -v for local access)

📂 Input File Format (input_file.txt)

Each line contains a path to a filing.
Lines starting with # are treated as comments and skipped.

Example:

# Example SEC filings list

data/EWCZ_20250813_PR.html

data/ACHR_20250811_PR.pdf

✅ Data Quality Checks

The pipeline enforces:

No duplicate primary keys

No future dates

Revenue > 0

Required metrics must exist

Completeness check for numeric columns
